This model simulates the motion of a double pendulum system, which consists of two masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) connected by rigid rods of lengths \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \). Given the initial angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), angular velocities \( \dot{\theta}_1 \) and \( \dot{\theta}_2 \), and the gravitational acceleration \( g \), the model calculates the angular accelerations \( \ddot{\theta}_1 \) and \( \ddot{\theta}_2 \) based on the nonlinear, coupled differential equations governing the double pendulum.
